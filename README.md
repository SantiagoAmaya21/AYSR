# Network Architecture & Services Labs

Collection of academic labs completed for **AYSR — Network Architecture and Services** at *Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito*.  
This repository showcases hands-on work across multiple networking and system administration topics, applying concepts from all layers of the **TCP/IP model** through practical deployment and troubleshooting.

---

## Main Objectives
- Configure and manage diverse operating systems and network services
- Understand and apply concepts from **Application → Physical layers**
- Perform real-world network analysis, monitoring, and validation
- Develop automation skills using scripting and virtualization/cloud platforms
